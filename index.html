    <h2>Brief Intro to sound map</h2>
    <h4>
      <p>
        Soundmap is a digital game where players travel to specific locations to
        collect music. Each music drop can include tracks from well-known
        artists or new ones. Songs have different rarities: common, uncommon,
        and rare, based on their current streams. There are also three special
        rarities: Shiny, Epic, and Exclusive songs. Shiny songs can be found
        through regular drops, collecting gems, or quests. Epic songs are also
        found in regular drops and rarely through quests, with the first person
        to get an Epic receiving the #1 version, the second getting the #2, and
        so on. Exclusive songs are extremely rare and only found through map
        drops, often during collaborations with artists for limited edition
        releases. So far, collaborations have included Rex Orange County and
        Doja Cat. You can also trade songs of any rarity with other players,
        including up to 8 songs and coins to make a good offer. For instance, if
        you really want a #1 Michael Jackson Thriller Epic, you might offer 8
        different Epics or a mix of Epics and Shinies to make a compelling
        trade.

               Unfortunatley these stats aren't up to date. As I'm writing this my account is currently banned. The support team believes that I am some sort of "Foreign Scammer", and currently I am in the process of trying to get my account unbanned, I'm not super hopeful because this particular support team is notorious for being unhelpful
