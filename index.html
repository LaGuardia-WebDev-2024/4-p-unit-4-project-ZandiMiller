    <h2>Brief Intro to sound map</h2>
    <h4>
      <p>
        Soundmap is a digital game where players travel to specific locations to
        collect music. Each music drop can include tracks from well-known
        artists or new ones. Songs have different rarities: common, uncommon,
        and rare, based on their current streams. There are also three special
        rarities: Shiny, Epic, and Exclusive songs. Shiny songs can be found
        through regular drops, collecting gems, or quests. Epic songs are also
        found in regular drops and rarely through quests, with the first person
        to get an Epic receiving the #1 version, the second getting the #2, and
        so on. Exclusive songs are extremely rare and only found through map
        drops, often during collaborations with artists for limited edition
        releases. So far, collaborations have included Rex Orange County and
        Doja Cat. You can also trade songs of any rarity with other players,
        including up to 8 songs and coins to make a good offer. For instance, if
        you really want a #1 Michael Jackson Thriller Epic, you might offer 8
        different Epics or a mix of Epics and Shinies to make a compelling
        trade.

               Unfortunatley these stats aren't up to date. As I'm writing this my account is currently banned. The support team believes that I am some sort of "Foreign Scammer", and currently I am in the process of trying to get my account unbanned, I'm not super hopeful because this particular support team is notorious for being unhelpful.

               WHAT NOW?
             </h2>
             <h4>
        Now that I have been RUDELY BANNED for something I didn't do, you're probably wondering how I pass the time nowadays... Well I began play this game action fighting game to suffice. I used to play as a kid and thought i'd pick it back up. And esentially you pick a lineup of 3 DC heros or villians and you fight off another 3 different different heros or villians. You're probably thinking... "This sounds nothing like soundmap", and you'd be right... while I did love Sound Map, It was also very time consuming and sometimes really draining because I would play all hours of the day trying to get my favorite songs. Not sure how long this hiatus will be, but if it is the end of my Sound Mapping experience I would like to say I am super grateful for the app overall and it's ability to familiarize me with artist I thought I'd never listen to, or even refamilizaring me with artist I haven't listened to in a while. In the summer I needed a distraction, because I wasn't at my best, I deleted instagram because social media just became upsetting and soundmap was a good substitute. I've been able to find others who share my very niche music taste, that I otherwise wouldn't have met.
