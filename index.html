    <h2>INTRO TO SOUNDMAP</h2>
    <h4>
      <p id="map">
        Soundmap is a digital game where players travel to specific locations to
        collect music. Each music drop can include tracks from well-known
        artists or new ones. Songs have different rarities: common, uncommon,
        and rare, based on their current streams. There are also three special
        rarities: Shiny, Epic, and Exclusive songs. Shiny songs can be found
        through regular drops, collecting gems, or quests. Epic songs are also
        found in regular drops and rarely through quests, with the first person
        to get an Epic receiving the #1 version, the second getting the #2, and
        so on. Exclusive songs are extremely rare and only found through map
        drops, often during collaborations with artists for limited edition
        releases. So far, collaborations have included Rex Orange County and
        Doja Cat. You can also trade songs of any rarity with other players,
        including up to 8 songs and coins to make a good offer. For instance, if
        you really want a #1 Michael Jackson Thriller Epic, you might offer 8
        different Epics or a mix of Epics and Shinies to make a compelling
        trade.

     ADDITIONAL FEATURES
      <h4> <p id="map">
        Sound Map also has extra features to make the game more engaging. They have "Aux Battles," where you pick a song that matches a given prompt and compete against someone else; the person with the most votes after 24 hours wins 1 gem. There's also a prediction game where you choose 3 different artists and guess if they'll get more or fewer streams in the next 24 hours; getting at least 2 out of 3 guesses right earns you 1 gem. Another cool feature is "Sound Map Brackets," where a theme is chosen, and 16 songs based on that theme compete in a tournament-style poll. You get coins for each correct guess, and a perfect guessing streak for the week earns you 5 gems. Sound Map also has leagues based on the XP you earn. Ranking 1st, 2nd, or 3rd by the end of the week gives you a gem prize and moves you up to the next league, with Bronze being the lowest and Diamond the highest. You usually compete against people at a similar level and XP.</p> </h4>

             Unfortunately, these stats aren't current. As I'm writing this, my account is banned.

               WHAT NOW?
             </h2>
             <h4> <p id="map">
      Now that I've been unfairly banned for something I didn't do, you might be curious about how I spend my time now... Well, I started playing this action fighting game to keep busy. I used to play it as a kid and thought I'd give it another go. Basically, you choose a lineup of 3 DC heroes or villains and battle against another team of 3 different heroes or villains. You‚Äôre probably thinking, "This doesn't sound like a Sound Map at all," and you'd be right. While I loved Sound Map, it was very time consuming and sometimes exhausting because I'd spend hours trying to get my favorite songs. I'm not sure how long this break will last, but if it's the end of my Sound Mapping days, I want to say I'm very grateful for the app. It helped me discover artists I never thought I'd listen to and reconnect with ones I hadn't heard in a while. Over the summer, I needed a distraction because I wasn't feeling my best. I deleted Instagram because social media was upsetting, and Sound Map was a good alternative. I've been able to find others who share my very niche music taste, people I wouldn't have met otherwise.
